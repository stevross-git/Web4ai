# Deployment

Deployment is intentionally simple to keep the focus on experimentation.  A
basic development setup can be started directly from the source tree:

```bash
python -m examples.simple_mesh
```

For containerised environments, review the provided Docker files.  They
illustrate how to bundle the mesh node with its Python dependencies.  Further
automation and orchestration are left to the user.
