# API Reference

This section provides a brief overview of the main modules shipped with
**Enhanced Node Network**.  Each module exposes a minimal API so that you can
experiment with mesh networking concepts without needing to study a large code
base.

- **core** – primitives for running a mesh node and managing peers
- **protocols** – adapters for different networking backends
- **integration** – utilities for connecting the mesh to external services

The code is intentionally lightweight and is meant as a starting point for more
comprehensive documentation in the future.
